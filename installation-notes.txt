# Installation and setup notes:

Mac OSX:
- Before installing Python, you have to install the Homebrew package manager if you haven’t already. Use the following code to do so:
  $ brew update
  $ brew install python

- You can create the virtual environment by opening the command prompt and typing the following code:
  $ python3 -m venv --system-site-packages ./venv
- You can activate the virtual environment by typing the following code:
  $ source ./venv/bin/activate

RASA Installation:
- Installing Rasa and Rasa X:
  You can install both Rasa and Rasa X using the following code:
  $ pip install rasa-x --extra-index-url https://pypi.rasa.com/simple

  Use the following code only if you want to install Rasa:
  $ pip install rasa

- Install Rasa NLU and Spacy in the same command prompt:
  $ pip install rasa[spacy]
  $ python -m spacy download en_core_web_md
  $ python -m spacy link en_core_web_md en

- To train your restaurant bot, execute
  $ rasa train

  $ rasa run actions

- To chat with the bot on the command line, run
  rasa shell



Windows:
- Use the following code and check whether your Python environment is already installed:
  # python3 --version
- If not, then install it using
  # C:\> pip3 install -U pip

- Visual Studio: (For Windows only)
  Open the Microsoft Visual Studio link: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
  Select ‘Community version 2019’
  Download the installer and select VC++ Build tools on the list

- Creating a virtual environment
  We strongly recommend that you create a virtual environment before installing Rasa and Rasa X.
  Virtual environment tools like virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper provide isolated Python environments.
  They help you install packages without any dependency conflicts and root privileges.

-  You can create a virtual environment by opening the command prompt and typing the following code:
  # C:\> python3 -m venv --system-site-packages ./venv
- You can activate the virtual environment by typing the following code:
  # C:\> .\venv\Scripts\activate

- After setting up virtualenv in windows, follow the Rasa Installation steps mentioned above.
